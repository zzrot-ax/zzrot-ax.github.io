# 320 Final Project: Bee Colonies and Their Regional Stressors
Examines the correlations between different stressors and colonies' percent loss based on region. Project can be viewed in the Final Project file under FinalProj.ipynb.  

## Data
Analyzes datasets retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyleahmurphy/nass-honey-bee-20152021). Data is collected from the USDA NASS program from 2015-2021, and includes colony data from part-timer and commercial operations.  
Includes:  
- Bee Colony Data (numbers of colonies, losses, renovations)
- Bee Honey Data (number of colonies, honey per colony, price)
- Bee Stressor Data (includes infestations, viruses, weather, queen failiures, etc.)

## About the Project  
This project includes:
- A brief introduction to the importance of learning the source of bee colony losses
- Data exploration of bee colony data sets looking specifically at regional losses, renovations, and primary stressors
- Use of a linear regression model to examine correlation between each region and stressors
